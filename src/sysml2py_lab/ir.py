"""Loss-minimizing IR for SysML text (issue #7).

The IR replaces the brace heuristic with a comment/string-aware parse:

  - `lexer.tokenize_sysml` tiles the input into tokens (100% coverage).
  - `statement_segments` splits the token stream into statements on
    `;` and brace boundaries, joining multi-line continuations into a
    single statement (so a 4-line transition is ONE statement, not four).
  - `parse_ir` builds a tree of `IRNode`s with kind/name/modifiers/
    type_refs/multiplicity/children/source_span/raw_text/fidelity.

Fidelity rules (loss-minimizing by design):
  - `modelled`   — the node's kind is known to the relationship model
                   (issue #6 children model) and its header decomposed.
  - `partial`    — the node's kind is known but the body/header could not
                   be fully decomposed (e.g. an unsupported construct).
  - `opaque`     — the node could not be classified (unknown construct).
At minimum it preserves the raw_text so nothing is silently dropped.

Comments are retained as IR nodes (kind `comment`).
